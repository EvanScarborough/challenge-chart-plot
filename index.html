          <h2>Read Me</h2>
          <h2>Design Choices</h2>
          <p>
            I used CodeMirror for the text editor because it looked good (although I couldn't
            change the font without messing up the cursor location...).<br><br>
            The plot was done with chart.js, since it is easy to implement (D3 would have
            been a bit overkill I think).<br><br>
            I did not use React for this project. I thought that there were not
            going to be many elements on the screen, so I didn't think it was necessary to
            use a framework like that. I am using jquery though.
          </p>
          <h2>Functionality</h2>
          <p>
            The code typed in the text editor is plotted. To do this, the raw string is
            parsed with JSON.parse(). However, some changes needed to be made to the string.
            (See the formatRawJSON function in editor.js)<br><br>
            The data is then processed into a more usable object ('data' in editor.js).
            This object is designed to have a sub-object for each group, so it's
            basically a tree of all the groups. Then it has an array for each "select"
            series.<br><br>
            I did it this way because it stores the data in one location before plotting
            it could have just placed the data straight into the plot, but I decided
            against that because then updating the span later could make it drop data.
            Also this is a good way to sort the data before plotting.
            (Also this is just better practice to have the data model separate from the view)
            It would, however, have made it run faster to skip this layer.
          </p>
          <h2>Protecting against huge datasets</h2>
          <p>
            There are a few ways that this protects against lots of data. For the most part,
            however, it lets you input as much data as you want. I could have made it
            limit the user to 10,000 events or something, but I opted instead to allow this,
            but just make sure that the screen is never frozen from it.<br><br>
            The main protection is just the "asynchronous" behavior of loading the data.
            (It's not actually asynchronous) The list of elements is processed in
            batches. It will process 50, then pause for a few milliseconds to let the
            screen update. The bottom bar reports its progress and the plot is updated
            as it loads, so the user knows it is working even if it takes a long time. Plotting
            can be canceled too. I believe this makes for a better user experience,
            even if it could be slower to process the data (we should have the back
            end doing all the serious data crunching anyway!).<br><br>
            In addition, the plot is guarded against plotting too many points at once.
            Each series can have a maximum of POINT_LIMIT points. It divides the span into
            that many intervals and doesn't plot points that are less than that length
            apart from each other.
          </p>
          <h2>Testing</h2>
          <p>
            I added a new event type of "test" that just loads in an entire new section set
            of data. Click the test button at the bottom and copy in one of the commented tests
            to the test parameter.<br><br>
            Many of the tests are focused on creating huge data sets to stress-test the
            plotting. Some may take a long time to process, but the screen is responsive always.<br><br>
            Other tests just make sure the basic functionality of the app works.
          </p>
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            There are a number of things that could be improved upon, and it could stand to have
            more tests. I might want to add a way to optionally plot large datasets faster
            by making the data load straight into the chart. Also the testing interface could
            be more usable with just buttons to run the tests. But overall it works very well
            I think!
